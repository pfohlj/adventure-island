As the last stone falls into place, you feel a deep rumbling
beneath your feet.  The lights eminating from the five holes
intensifies until you are blinded by the light filling the
cave.  All of a sudden, a loud wind rushes through the cave
and the lights go out, plunging the cave into darkness.

Once you recover your sight, you notice something strange in
front of the piles of colored stones.  It appears that
something has placed a red orb on the ground.  Its surface is 
glossy and as you approach it, you can make out a vibration
in the air around it.  

You pick it up and upon touching it, you feel a tingling
sensation traveling through your whole body.  It is neither 
pleasant nor unplesant.  You attempt to place the orb in your
bag.
