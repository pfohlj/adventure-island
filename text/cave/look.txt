You find yourself in a cave, recessed into the face of the
cliff.  On the cave's walls are a number of interesting 
paintings, all related to the island.  To your left.  
crumpled up on the floor is the desicated skeleton of a man.
In his dry and bony fingers is what appears to be a crumpled
up piece of paper.  

Further back in the cave is an odd arrangement of colored
stones.  There are five piles, each placed next to one another.
The first pile is all purple stones, the second yellow, the third
orange, the fourth green, and the fifth teal.  Just past the 
stones are five holes in the ground.  Each hole is numbered, 
starting with 1 and ending with 5.  What could this be?
