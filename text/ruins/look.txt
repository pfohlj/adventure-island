You are standing in the middle of a jungle clearing, 
surrounded by what appears to be the ruins of some ancient
civilization.  As you explore, you notice there seems to be 
a central area around which all of the structures are built.

intricately carved totem.  Past the totem is a opening, sunk
into the ground.  On the other side of the center clearing
is a golden altar.
