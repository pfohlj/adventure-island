As soon as you answer the last question, the figure lets out
a shriek and begins to fly around the room in faster and

there is another bright flash of light.  When your vision 
clears, the figure is gone, and the room feels more open.

You approach the box and open it up to discover a silver key.
You pick it up and attempt to add it to your inventory.
