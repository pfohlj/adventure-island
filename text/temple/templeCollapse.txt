As you approach the altar, the air around you begins to 
crackle with energy.  Every hair on your body begins to stand
on end and you feel a deep rhythmic rumble beneath your feet.
From the bag you're wearing on your back, you hear a huming
sound.

You pull out the two orbs in your bag and notice that they 
have begun to glow and swirl and an internal light.  When you 
reach the altar, you can see that there are two cups, one
glowing red, and the other glowing blue.  It is obvious that
this altar was designed for the two orbs you are holding.  

You place the red orb in its cup, and a thundering BOOM 
sounds.  The ground shakes and temple around you groans
under the stress the quaking places upon it.  You place the 
blue orb in its cup and another thundering BOOM sounds, this 
time followed by a growling metalic shriek.  

As you turn to find the source of the noise, you notice that
the sand beneath your feet has begun to slide towards the 
center of the temple clearing, where it is being sucked into 
hole in the ground.  The pit grows wider and wider and you 
scramble to escape its pull but it is too late.  Along with
the sand and the now crumbling stones of the temple, you
are pulled into the abyss.  Something strikes you on the
temple and you fade away into unconsiousness.
