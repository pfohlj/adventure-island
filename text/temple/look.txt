As you enter the clearing, expecting to find the totem and 
the broken box, your breath is taken away by the sign of a 
massive stone temple.  Where the totem once stood, you now
see a towering structure that looks as if it has been there
for ages.  That explains the shaking you experienced after 
discovering the blur orb!

The temple is designed around a central space that is open
to the sky above.  Around this central space are five 
massive towers, each topped with the image of a fish.  The
five towers are all different colors.  One gree, one purple,
one orange, one yellow, and one teal!  

In the very center of the temple, sitting in a single shaft
of sunlight is a crystal altar, refracting a rainbow of 
colors over the temples many stone surfaces.  It is almost
too bright to look at!

On all four sides of the temple are the paths leading to the
four sides of the island.  Each is marked with a sign, with 
words you now know the meaning of.
