After swimming out into the ocean a ways, you come to a reef.
Standing on the reef, the water us just about up to your
knees.  Everywhere you look, there are beautully colored fish
swimming around.  The sight takes your breath away.

At your feet, a particularly stunning fish swims around you
in circles.  As you watch it, you notice that it is slowly
shifting colors from green, to purple, and then orange, 
then yellow, and finally teal.  What kind of fish can this
be?

To your right, a mass of deep green seaweed floats just below
the gently rippling waves.  To your left you notice a bottle 
floating on the surface of the water.
