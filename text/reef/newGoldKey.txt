You tie the hook onto the end of the string and lower them
into the water.  Before the hooks can even fully sink into
the water, the amazing color changing fish sucks up the hook
and begins to tug at the string.

You pull the string and manage to extract the fish from the 
water.  As you work to remove the hook from the fish's mouth,
it begins to open and close its mouth and stare into your
eyes.

After a few seconds of this, a Gold Key emerges from the 
fish's mouth and drops into the ocean, floating down to rest
on the reef. As you watch the key drop, the fish wriggles
free of the hook, escapes your hands, and splashes back into
the water.  

You reach down into the water, pick up the key, and attempt 
to place it into your leather bag.
