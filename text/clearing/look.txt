You're standing in a large jungle clearing with a huge 
totem in its center. Next to the totem is a broken wooden 
box.

On all four sides of the totem are paths leading off into
the jungle. Each path is marked by a sign with one of
four words on it. The sign by the northern path says 
"Casucha," the sign by the eastern path says "Krutajo," 
the sign by the southern path says "Ruinoj," and the 
sign by the western path says "Skatolo."
