You head over to the broken box and examine its top.  It
looks like the box was carried into the clearing and left
here by someone, but who?  As you wrench back the broken
cover, you discover that the box contains a rope ladder!
On the ends of the rope ladder are intricately carved metal
hooks.  You pick up the rope ladder and attempt to add it to
your bag.
