As the last lever clicks into place, the noise of gears
grinding against one another begins to fill the room.  At
the base of the wall, a small slot slowly opens up.  From 
the slot rolls a blue orb similar to the red one you found
in the cliff cave.

It rolls to your feet and stops there, instantly filling the
room with the sensation of crackling energy.  As you pick 
the orb up annd hold it in your hand, a strange tingling 
sensation travels up your arm and through your body.  You 
attempt to place the orb in your bag.
