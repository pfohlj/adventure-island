Directly in front of you, you can see a old, crumbling hut.  
It looks as it if has been abandoned for ages.  Through the 
rotting walls you can see an old bookshelf, a ratty carpet, 
and a pile of blankets.

Across the clearing is another path marked with a sign reading
"Krutajo."  The path you just emerged from is marked with a
sign reading "Skatolo." Across from the hut is an overgrown
path leading into the jungle.
