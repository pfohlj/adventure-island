As you investigate the old bookshelf, you notice some sort 
of hinge in the wall behind it.  You slide the bookshelf to
the side and by doing so reveal a secret door!  It appears
that the door is locked.  As you look closer, you notice 
the lock is a gold lock.  Could it be that the key you 
received from the fish unlocks this door?

You remove the gold key from your bag and slide it into the
lock.  You turn it to the side, and with a satisfying click,
the the locks releases and the door swings open, revealing 
a set of stairs descending into the dark.
