You emerge from the path on a rocky outcropping overlooking
the crashing waves below.  As you move forward you realize
that you're standing on the top of a huge cliff.  The 
heights are staggering and the rushing wind takes your
breath away.

Across the clearing you notice another path with a sign 
marked "Ruinoj."  Behind you, the path is marked with a sign
saying "Casucha."  In the middle of the clearing is a pile of
rocks.  As you scan the clearing, something shiny in the rocks
catches your eye.  On the edge of the cliffs you notice what
appears to be two metal rungs sunk into the rocks.  There also
appears to be an overgrown trail leading into the jungle.
