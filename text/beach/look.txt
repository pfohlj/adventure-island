You're standing on a pristine beach, with a dense, dark
jungle behind you.  A cool breeze blows across your face as
you survey the vast expanse of water before your eyes. The
water is a beautiful shade of teal and intensely clear. Far
out into the water, you see what might be a reef.

On the north side of the beach is a path leading into the
jungle.  There is a sign by the path marked with the word 
"Casucha." The east side of the beach butts up against the 
jungle and there appears to be a trail but its hard to make 
out from your current position. On the south side of the 
clearing is a path leading into the jungle.  There is a sign
by the path marked with the word "Ruinoj."

Where the ocean meets the beach is a pile of smooth
driftwood.  It appears to have been there for a long time.
To your right, you notice a partially buried chest in the
sand.  From your current position, you can't make out if 
its open or closed.  Just behind you is a stand of palm 
trees.
