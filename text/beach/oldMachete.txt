You insert the silver key in your inventory into the box's 
silver lock. Somehow, the machete has ended up back where 
you first found it. "Is this island magic?" you think to 
yourself.  "If so, is it friendly or is it dangerous magic?"
You reach into the box, pick up the machete, and go to
place it in your bag.
